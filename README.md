A link for the installion of this software is at <a href="https://indiana.portal.airast.org/secure-browsers.stml">Secure Browsers</a> for official setup instructions.</b>

How it works:
  It's really just a bash script which gets the files from the server (please have the URL ready to input) using wget, then unzips the file and places it in the ~/Documents folder. More instructions from there. 

WIP. Do not expect this to work without customization. Please submit a pull request if you see an issue to fix.
